            First, we'll dive into the fuel economy, in particular exploring the spectrum of
                    gasoline, electric, and diesel-powered cars. With this scene, you'll be equipped to
                    decide which type of fuel aligns with your driving style.

            Next, we'll dissect the top car companies and reveal their average fuel efficiency
                    on the highway and in the cities. We know that you will have their favorite car
                    company, and we are hopeful that our data can help you make an educated decision on
                    your next car. From classic legends to modern marvels, you'll discover the stars of
                    the automotive world, each vying to be your co-pilot on your road to adventure.

            Lastly, we'll hand over the steering wheel to you! Engage in an interactive session
                    where you can fine-tune your preferences based on the number of engine cylinders
                    you want in your car. In other words, if you want a car high in horsepower, a car
                    that's more eco-friendly, or a car somewhere in between.
